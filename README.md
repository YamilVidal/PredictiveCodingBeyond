# PredictiveCodingBeyond
EEG data preprocessing scripts from the paper "Predictive Coding beyond simple tone-based oddball designs"

https://doi.org/10.1101/581355

As some steps need to be done manually, code is divided in blocks.
Each block uses one folder as input and another as output.
To use it, download the data from one of the experiments and place the
 files into:

 ...\Data\1 - Sets\

Feel free to adapt this code for your own experiments
