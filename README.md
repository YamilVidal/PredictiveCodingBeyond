# Preprocessing pipeline
EEG data preprocessing scripts from the paper "Neural Signal to Violations of Abstract Rules Using Speech-Like Stimuli"

https://www.eneuro.org/content/6/5/ENEURO.0128-19.2019/

As some steps need to be done manually, code is divided in blocks.
Each block uses one folder as input and another as output.
To use it, download the data from one of the experiments and place the
 files into:

 ...\Data\1 - Sets\

Feel free to adapt this code for your own experiments
